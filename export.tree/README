## Overview

- [ ] Project name : Neural Correlates of Lidocaine Analgesic (NLA) Study

- [ ] Brief overview 
Twenty-seven adults (age 22-55) participated in this single-arm, open-label study. 
Pain response task and resting-state scans were obtained at baseline and then under a constant effect-site concentration of lidocaine at 3 T. 
Electric nerve stimulation, titrated in advance to 7/10 intensity, was employed (5x 10 sec) for the pain task.
